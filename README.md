This is the bot code for a discord server I run

It uses java and json files to create a database that can store all of a users data and make their lives easier
Im always adding on so this may not be the finished version at this time but it is fun to code and there is no limits to what it can do. 

My favorite features are probably the racial feature and the proxy feature. Both of which were kind of annoying to implement but I leaned a lot from the process and they hold a special place in my heart because of it
